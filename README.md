Data Overview and Cleaning:
What are the key characteristics of the dataset? (e.g., number of records, features, data types)
Identify and handle any missing or null values. Describe your approach and reasoning.
Check for and address any duplicate records.
Statistical Summary:
Provide a statistical summary of the dataset (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical features.
Identify and describe any significant outliers in the data.
Data Visualization:
Create visualizations to show the distribution of key weather parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed).
Plot time series graphs to visualize trends over time. Highlight any notable patterns or seasonal variations.
Create correlation matrices and heatmaps to identify relationships between different weather parameters.
Weather Patterns and Trends:
Analyze and describe any trends or patterns you observe in the data. For instance, how do temperature and humidity vary across different seasons or months?
Investigate any anomalies or unusual patterns in the data. What might be the reasons for these anomalies?
Insights and Conclusions:
Summarize the key insights you have gained from your EDA. What are the most interesting or surprising findings?
How can these insights be useful for weather prediction or other practical applications?
Recommendations for Further Analysis:
Suggest areas for further analysis or additional data that might be useful to explore.
